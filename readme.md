## Colony Clacker

Clicky-Clack Inspired Door For PFA Printers

![]()

Colony Clacker is a scaled down version of the awesome [Clicky-Clack Fridge Door](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door).

Completely remoddeled from scratch (not just resized), with added stealthy aesthetics. 
STLs have been optimised for best slicer performance with standard Voron print settings.

Provides the same satisfying clack when closing the door, whilst also increasing chamber temps, and reducing noise.

Initially designed for Micron+, but will fit all 1515 based printers that use 3mm foam tape, with 3mm Panels.

1mm variants in the works... stay tuned.
(The Colony Clacker Handle will work with existing Mini Fridge Hinges for V0 style printers.)
