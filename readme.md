## Colony Clacker

### A 'Clicky-Clack Fridge Door' inspired, clicky clacking door for the colony of Printers for Ants!

Colony Clacker is a scaled down version of the awesome [Clicky-Clack Fridge Door](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door) by tanaes.

Completely remoddeled from scratch (not just resized), with added stealthy aesthetics, improved tolerances, and STLs that have been optimised for best slicer performance with standard Voron print settings.

Provides the same satisfying clack when closing the door, whilst also increasing chamber temps, and reducing noise.

Initially designed for Micron+, but will fit all 1515 based printers that use 3mm foam tape, with 3mm Panels.

1mm foam variants in the works... stay tuned.

## Printing
All parts should be correctly orientated and should be printed with Standard Voron print settings.

## Assembly
Assembly is reletively self explanatory, the following images should help if you get stuck and can't access the CAD.

** Ensure you superglue your magnets into the latch and the corresponding handle piece. **
